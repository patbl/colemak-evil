Colemak Evil
============

Colemak Evil is a set of remappings that implements some of
Shai Coleman's awesome Vim remappings in Emacs
([more information](http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=50)).

It's usable, but I'm an expert in neither Vim nor Emacs, so you may encounter
some funky behavior. If you have any improvements, I'd be glad to integrate
them.

Here are a few of the main differences from Shai's mappings:

* The only Vim mapping that works in insert mode is Esc (this avoids
  conflicts with Emacs's shortucts).
* Folding and several other features aren't implemented.
* Tab in insert mode doesn't take you into normal mode. 

Setup
-----
1. [Install Evil](http://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home#Install), ace-jump-mode.
2. Download Colemak Evil and put it somewhere in your load path.
3. Add `(load "colemak-evil")` to your Emacs init file.

Tips
----

Type :hints (:h should also work) to bring up the hint screen.

Escape takes you into normal mode, but you may find that defining your
own key combination using [Key Chord](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/key-chord.el)
to be more comfortable. The only home-row combination that I know of
that is relatively uncommon in English is "hn." If you reduce the
delay, you can use a common combination, such as "ne." After setting
up Key Chord, the following worked for me:

    (setq key-chord-two-keys-delay .03)
    (key-chord-define-global "ne" 'evil-normal-state)

There are also some Vim features that haven't yet been implemented in
Evil. You'll probably have to add quite a few of your own mappings to
get your setup where you want it. For insert-mode mappings, check out
[ErgoEmacs](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding.html),
which provides saner alternatives to Emacs's mappings (there's a
Colemak version).
